# Machine Learning Demos ---- Chapter-2 Handwritten Digits Recognition #
## Author: Xinyu_Wang {xinke_wang.ss@qq.com} ##
This zip contains a Handwritten digits recognition demo, all the codes are implemented and tested under MATLAB R2015b

handwrittenDigitsRecognition.m is the entrance of the demo

## utils ##
In the directory 'utils', there are several functions:
* checkMNIST.m
    chek if the MNIST dataset has been downloaded
* downloadMNIST.m
    download the MNIST dataset and uncompress it
* LoadMNIST.m
    load MNIST dataset
* parsingMNIST.m
    parsing the MNIST dataset and save as matlab files

This is a very common example for computer vision beginners
